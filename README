This solution in the given files uses Professor Shaeffer's code to update the
     combat, equip, destroy, unequip, drop, and inspect items. It also lets you 
     look at any character in the dungeon. This includes the PC. He really 
     loves himself for some reason, I don't know why. He could just stare at 
     himself for hours.
